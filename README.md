# AttendeeList
A list populated from json using ReactJS

To run, have all files accessible through a web server in the same directory and open the AttendeeList.html file,
all necessary javascript libraries are referenced externally.

The json is loaded initially and react is used to display and interact with the data.
None of the changes are saved, only manipulated in state, so a page refresh will reload the original data.

## Expected Actions

* Change Meal
* Add / Remove tag
* Add Attendee to Group
* When clicking on an attendee highlight all other attendees they are attending with
* When clicking on a tag highlight all other attendees that have that tag
* When clicking on a meal highlight all other attendess that have that meal
